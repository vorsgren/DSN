Make sure to boot the installer in uefi mode on newer systems - otherwise grub will fail to install.

(investigate things other than grub)
-chroot install-
	login as anon, and create partitions:
	use fdisk to partition.
	make an MBR partition table on BIOS, GPT for UEFI. GRUB requires a special partition of ~500mb, vfat, at /boot/efi on uefi systems
	swap space: create a swap 3x the ram if under 2gb, 2x the ram for 2-8gb and 1.5x ram for greater than 8gb
        create a separate / and /home. 50gb for /, and add the rest to /home
	vfat to /efi partition, swap to swap, btrfs the / and /home partitions
		mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1
		mkswap /dev/sda2
		mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda3    (etc)
        make a directory, and mount them there:
 		mkdir /mnt
		mkdir /mnt/home
		mkdir /mnt/boot
 		mkdir /mnt/boot/efi
		mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/ #mounts as /
  		mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/home
		etc...
	Install from a rootfs tarball. You may need to install xz to untar first. Connect to wifi to do so.
		xbps-install xz
		tar xvf void-x86_64_ROOTFS-20221001.tar.xz -C /mnt
	Enter the Chroot:
		xbps-install -S xtools
		xchroot /mnt /bin/bash
	Install the base system, and update:
		xbps-install -Su xbps
		xbps-install -u
		xbps-install base-system
		xbps-remove base-voidstrap
	Specify the hostname in /etc/hostname
	Review contents of /etc/rc.conf
	For Glibc: edit /etc/default/libc-locales uncomment desired locales
	set a root passwd:
		passwd
	generate an fstab from current filesystem:
		cp /proc/mounts /etc/fstab
		in /etc/fstab, remove lines that refer to proc, sys, devtmpfs, pts and LIVEOS_ROOTFS
		Replce references to /dev/sdXX, etc with their UUID. YOu can get this by running blkid
		change the last zero of the entry for / to 1. And change the last zero of every other line to 2. This changes the behavior of fsck
		Add an entry to mount /tmp in ram:
			(in fstab) tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,nosuid,nodev 0 0
		Add entry for swap:
			(in fstab) UUID=XXXXXXX swap swap rw,noatime,discard 0 0
	Install Grub: 
		Bios:
			xbps-install -S grub
			grub-install /dev/sdX (/dev/sdX = drive that you are installing Grub to)
		UEFI:
			install grub-x86_64-efi, grub-i386-efi or grub-arm64-efi (depending on architecture)
			grub-install --target=XXXXXX-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id="Void" # Set bootloader ID as you wish
			Troubleshooting:
				If EFI variables are not available, add the option --no-nvram to the grub-install command
				For installing on removable medai, or noncompliant UEFI systems:
					try adding the option --removable to grub-install
					OR copy the installed grup executable into a boot directory you create.
						mkdir -p /boot/efi/EFI/boot
						cp /boot/efi/EFI/Void/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi #Location of grub executable can be found with efibootmgr
		ensure all installed packages are configure correctly:
			xbps-reconfigure -fa
		exit and reboot:
			exit
			umount -R /mnt
			shutdown
		On reboot, update:
			xbps-install -Su
-create new user, add sudo priviledges-
	useradd -m void
	passwd void
	visudo
		uncomment line that allows all members of wheel group to run any command
	usermod -aG wheel void
-to set a static ip-
	disable the dhcpcd service
	then add in the /etc/rc.local file:
		ip link set dev enp34s0 up
		ip addr add 192.168.1.5/24 brd + dev enp34s0
		ip route add default via 192.168.1.1
-set up wireless-
	most devices use WPA-PSK
	to add the SSID & password to the wpa_supplicant settings: sudo sh -c 'wpa_passphrase <MYSSID> <passphrase> >> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf'(need script to automte this, for logging into wifi in hotel, etc)
	to look for networking cards:
		run: ip addr
		results will have multiple options
		enp9s0 [or similar] = ethernet plug
		wlp2s0 [or similar] = wireless interface
	to scan:
		sudo iw wlp2s0 scan | grep SSID | less
	commands to start it, if not running:
		sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp5s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf 
		sudo dhcpcd wlp5s0
	then enable wpa supplicant and dhcpcd on startup with this, to enable in runit:
		ln -s /etc/sv/<service> /var/service/
	if you get an error like this (intel wireless): error snd_hda_intel no codecs found. - it may help to disable unneeded things like bluetooth in bios.
	if wifi doesn't normally start, just put the commands to start wifi in /etc/rc.local
-installation- -if you get an error stating Certificate verification failed ERROR: failed to fetch file (XXXXX): Operation not permitted likely the system time is off, and needs to be fixed.-
		Alternatively, bypass the checks with: export SSL_NO_VERIFY_PEER=1
	Once connected to the internet, and updated, install: (Try Alsamixer.app, sndio, Pipewire)
		xz unzip zsh htop firefox-esr mc vim alsa-lib alsa-utils gcc make git wget curl lm_sensors gimp libreoffice zathura Thunderbird keyd mpv most deluge persepolis obs newsboat vagrant task
	If you need to create ntfs partitions: 
		ntfs-3g 
	If Wayland:
		wayland river seatd foot fuzzel wl-clipboard cliphist gammastep swayimg mako kanshi swaylock waybar foot mpvpaper
	If Xorg (Using Nvidia)
		urxvt dmenu xorg-minimal xorg-fonts
	Intel cpu:
		linux-firmware-intel intel-ucode [nonfree], then regenerate the initramfs. To regenerate initramfs: sudo xbps-reconfigure -f linuxX.XX To find kernel version: sudo xbps-query -l | grep linux		
	AMD cpu:
		linux-firmware-amd
	AMD gpu:
		Gcn or later AMD gpu:
			linux-firmware-amd xf86-video-amdgpu
			Opengl: mesa-dri 
			Vulkan: vulkan-loader mesa-vulkan-radeon
			Hardware acceleration: mesa-vaapi mesa-vdpau
			also possibly:
				radeontop [a monitoring program]  
			Note that there are two radeon drivers for vulkan, mesa-vulkan-radeon and amdvlk. mesa-vulkan-radeon is generally better, and amdvlk should usually be avoided, it caused crashes for me. 
			The proprietary amdgpu-pro drivers should also usually be avoided.
		Terascale or earlier: (see if improve this section)
			linux-firmware-amd xf86-video-ati
			Opengl: mesa-dri 
			Hardware acceleration: mesa-vaapi mesa-vdpau
			also possibly:
				radeontop [a monitoring program]
	Nvidia gpu: [Nvidia Wayland support is in poor shape at this time]
		The open source nouveau driver [works very poorly on 2nd gen Maxwell and newer [works okish on 750ti, etc]], only opengl, not suggested on Maxwell and newer architectures:
			xf86-video-nouveau
			if needed: mesa-dri-32-bit
			(look into the nvk driver)
		Nvidia proprietary drivers:
			Maxwell architecture and newer:
				nvidia [nonfree]
				if needed: nvidia-libs-32bit [nonfree]
			Kepler architecture:
				nvidia470 [nonfree]
				if needed: nvidia470-libs-32bit [nonfree]
			Fermi architecture:
				nvidia390 [nonfree]
				if needed: nvidia390-libs-32bit [nonfree]
			Tesla architecture and older:
				not available in repos, it is suggested to use nouveau
		Enabling Nvidia Optimus [switchable graphics]
			Prime Render Offload [available on newest nvidia driver only, best option.]
				First, create an xorg.conf file: Xorg :1 -configure
				and copy it to X11 conf location: cp /root/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf
				In Xorg.conf:
				Then, under the ServerLayout section, add: Option "AllowNVIDIAGPUScreens"
				Under the device for the Nvidia GPU, add: Option "AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration"
				Make a new section named "ServerFlags" with the line: Option "IgnoreABI" "1"
				Then, you can run commands with prime-run in front of them, to make them use the nvidia card.
		Monitoring: install nvtop
	Intel gpu: (add section on monitoring)
		linux-firmware-intel
		xf86-video-intel
		Opengl: mesa-dri
		Vulkan: vulkan-loader mesa-vulkan-intel
		Hardware acceleration: intel-video-accel
			Some issues can be solved by turning iommu off in the kernel cmdline
	sometimes, pulseaudio is needed, then install:
		pulseaudio pavucontrol
	-enabling river-
		ln -s /etc/sv/seatd /var/service
		create/place ~/.config/river/init , and make executable
		put this line in /etc/environment
			XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/home/void/.config/1000 (1000 = Uid)
		create ~/.config/1000, chmod 700 it
	to setup sensors:
		sudo sensors-detect, and default for the options, yes to generate config.
	other repositories:
		other repositories exist, they can be installed like any other package, they are:
		void-repo-nonfree
		void-repo-multilib
		void-repo-multilib-nonfree
		void-repo-debug
	-timezones-
		to change the default timezone:
		rm -rf /etc/localtime
		sudo ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Denver /etc/localtime (find your zone in zoneinfo directory)
	-date- (if you are having problems with resetting, make sure it is correct in bios)
		set date:
		date -s '2023-5-1 18:00:00'
	-default shell to zsh-
		chsh -s /bin/zsh
	-wayland setup-
		(download river config file)
		enabling dbus service is necessary
		is elogind needed? or seatd?
	-steam-
		install: void-repo-nonfree void-repo-multilib
		then install: steam libgcc-32bit libstdc++-32bit libdrm-32bit libglvnd-32bit
		if using open source gpu driver [amd, nouveau], also install: mesa-dri-32bit
		if nvidia proprietary, install: nvidia-libs-32bit nvidia390-libs-32bit [both latest, update as necessary](why do i have the 390 here?)
		
		If some vulkan games (or direct3d, which is translated to vulkan) are not launching, try running steam from the terminal, and see what pops up. 
			If you get Vulkan errors like "Vulkan missing required extension 'VK_KHR_surface'" and "Blinit unable to initiate Vulkan", try and search for 'vulkan' packages in the void packages, and install stuff. 
			The reason is that some Vulkan extensions are missing. I'm not sure what packages it was, becuase I tried to uninstall them, and it didn't break? Figure out later.)   
		In an Nvidia Optimus config, steam must be run with prime-run.
-alsa-
	edit [or create] the file /etc/asound.conf
		if multiple sound sources are not found, this in asound.conf may help. It has caused problems in other cases, not good to add by default.
			pcm.dsp {
    				type plug
    				slave.pcm "dmix"
			}
		if old soundcards are removed, they may have entries in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa.conf, which can cause problems. Good idea to remove them if issues.
-to remove older kernels-
	sudo vkpurge rm all
(add modded skyrim section)
-wine gaming general, wineGE-
	
	enabling esync - esync is a thing that removes some overhead and can make games run faster, especially as they are more multithreaded.  guide: https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/HowToEsync.md
		To check if Esync is enabled -  run the ulimit -Hn command. If the value printed is equal to or greater than 524288, then your system is Esync-compatible.
		if it is lower, you can fix it by modifying /etc/security/limits.conf change/create this line: username hard nofile 524288    Then reboot. check with ulimit -Hn
		To start a program with Esync, start the program with WINESYNC=1

	install wine winetricks libwine libwine-32bit protontricks wine-32bit wine-common wine-devel wine-devel-32bit wine-gecko wine-mono wine-tools (see if all of these are necessary)

	install (if nvidia) nvidia nvidia-dkms nvidia-libs linux-firmware-nvidia nvidia-libs-32bit   (see if all of these are necessary)
	(add amd gpu section)

	it is usually best practice to create a new prefix for each game
	
	To set up a prefix:
		make a descriptive folder, e.g, skyrim-wineGE

		run: WINEPREFIX=/home/username/skyrim-wineGE winecfg
			the window with wine options should appear, meaning that the wine prefix is set up correctly
			In the winecfg window, switch from windows 7 to 10 and apply (skyrim tools LOOT requires this, not necessary if doing it with other games probably)
		run: export WINEPREFIX=/home/username/skyrim-wineGE
	install dlls:
		these dlls will be sufficient to run most dx9, dx10, dx11 games, and various skyrim tools, but your mileage may vary.
		
		run: WINEPREFIX=/home/username/skyrim-wineGE winetricks --force dotnet20 dotnet48 d3dcompiler_43 d3dcompiler_47 d3dx9 d3dx10 d3dx11_42 d3dx11_43 faudio vcrun2008 vcrun2010 vcrun2012 vcrun2013 vcrun2015 vcrun2019 quartz faudio
			(you can also run WINEPREFIX=/home/username/skyrim-wineGE winetricks to get a gui to install stuff)
	install the game:
		run: WINEPREFIX=/home/username/skyrim-wineGE ./home/username/location-of-wineGE/lutris-GE-Proton7-25-x86_64/bin/wine /location/of/game/install/file.e
			If it is just a copied skyrim folder, there is no need to do this.
	install mods:
		run Mo2 installer: WINEPREFIX=/home/username/skyrim-wineGE /home/username/location-of-wineGE/lutris-GE-Proton7-25-x86_64/bin/wine '/location/of/Mod Organizer 2-6194-2-4-4-1640622655.exe'
			the default install location should work fine
			
		run LOOT installer: WINEPREFIX=/home/username/skyrim-wineGE /home/username/location-of-wineGE/lutris-GE-Proton7-25-x86_64/bin/wine '/location/of/LOOT v0.18.3 - Installer -1918-0-18-3-1653157089.exe'
			defaults are fine. If LOOT can't find the Skyrim Install, go to file > settings > Skyrim Special Edition > and browse to the install path 
				OR edit: vim /home/username/location-of-wineGE-prefix/drive_c/users/username/AppData/Local/Loot/settings.toml2, find the Skyrim Special Edition section, and add the path to the game.

		run Wrye Bash installer: WINEPREFIX=/home/usernameskyrim-wineGE /home/username/location-of-wineGE/lutris-GE-Proton7-25-x86_64/bin/wine '/location/of/Wrye Bash 310 - Installer-6837-310-1658670517.exe'
			Make sure box is checked for SkyrimSE. If it can't detect SkyrimSE, install to an extra location (make sure to check the box next to the extra location path) Then close installer.
		
		run Mo2: WINEPREFIX=/home/username/skyrim-wineGE /home/username/location-of-wineGE/lutris-GE-Proton7-25-x86_64/bin/wine /home/void/skyrim-wineGE/drive_c/Modding/MO2/ModOrganizer.exe

		create a new instance - it should see the game automatically - if not, select the 'Skyrim Special Edition' folder manually. I suggest just using a portable instance.
		I don't install mods through Nexus, I like to keep separate copies as privately stored files, and Nexus connection feature can be buggy, so I suggest not connecting to Nexus.
		there will be errors in the terminal and the Mo2 Log - these are usually safe to ignore.

		two misrendered black windows pop up. THe first is a tutorial you can follow, say no to the second. (sometimes they are not misrendered)

		To add LOOT to MO2, go to modify executables (looks like gears), add executable, add empty. Title it LOOT. Place the path in binary slot, e.g \home\void\skyrim-wineGE\drive_c\Program Files\LOOT\LOOT.exe 
			Apply and close. (backslashes are here as Mo2 is windows program, it expects them)

		To add Wrye Bash to MO2, go to modify executables (looks like gears), add executable, add empty. Title it Wrye Bash. Place the path in binary slot, e.g \home\void\TES -Skyrim - Anniversary Edition\Mopy\Wrye Bash.exe 
			Apply and close. (Wrye Bash install folder is named Mopy, unknown why) (backslashes are here as Mo2 is windows program, it expects them)
		Finally, to run with mods, make sure you run the cracked steamless launcher from within Mo2. (This didn't work - wine can't launch the patched .exe) (maybe try other emulators, like Smart Steam Emu, steamstub remover)
			(add section for manual install of SKSE)
	alternative, running Mo2 through Steam:
		Make sure Skyrim has run, and set it to use Proton 7.0 (script says to use 6.8. ignore it). No launch commands. Make sure Skyrim isn't running, and run the mo2 install script. (if it errors and talks about xdg-mime, install xdg-utils) 
			It will install SKSE, and map Mo2 to the play skyrim button in steam.
			If Skyrim has no sound after doing this, place   WINEDLLOVERIDES="xaudio2_7=n,b" PULSE_LATENCY-MSEC=90 %command%      in the skyrim arguments.
			If Skyrim shows the Bethesda logo, then blackscreens, check both boxes for both windowed and borderless window in the old launcher (you can add it's path to Mo2, to adjust graphics settings as well)

-ssh- (fix it)
	make sure openssh is installed
	enable the sshd service (on machine you will be tunneling into)
	supposedly, adding: IPQoS lowdelay to ~/.ssh/config can help when it times out for no reason. the default breaks on network, while 'lowdelay' works in some cases. (from voidlinux reddit, search for ssh)	
(add section on changing shell to zsh)
waybar should show in a blank screen and automatically hide when you open a window, and automatically unhide when all windows are closed. There should also be a shortcut to toggle waybar when windows are open.
(get cli music player - moc looks good)	
(see about getting an email client)(thunderbird, cmd email clients)
(investigate if an IRC is needed)

(cutomize river for ultrawide)
(add section on video players, etc)
(add section on image viewers, etc)
(look into replacing sudo with doas)
(add modded minecraft section)

	add "padsp" in front of factorio if it isn't working with pulseaudio
(see if trim is a good idea for ssds)
(figure out how to fix usb owned by root)
(look into sleep and resume on laptops)
(look into lockscreens, for security)

(add xbps-src section)
(look at leaking dns servers)
(add section about enabling runit services)
(add section about compiling kernel)
	install ncurses devel flex
(add firefox/librewolf  section)
	accessibility off is good - supposed to be a memory leak
-xdeb- (add section on using xdeb to convert .deb to xbps packages)
-to install and compile dwm- (look at doing with xbps-src) (for xorg only)
	install: libXinerama-devel libXft-devel
	then download dwm: wget https://dl.suckless.org/dwm/dwm-6.4.tar.gz
	once unpacked into a different folder, change in config.def.h:
		int showbar to 0
		cyan color to #440000
		remove the firefox rules line
		change Mod1Mask to Mod4Mask
		change dmenu spawn from XK_p to XK_d, and incmaster to XK_p from XK_d
		remove shiftmask from spwan terminal, add to zoom
	Then run: sudo make clean install
	create the file .xinitrc in /home/<username>/. Contents: exec dwm
	run with startx
	after this, the packages installed can be removed.
-mc-
	change skin to modarcon16-defbg (modarcon16root-defbg for root)
	hide menubar
	hide hintbar
-zram- (what algorithm is best?) (is one per core best?) # smaller size 80% of Ram, so incompressible data does not cause a blowup
	sudo sh -c 'echo "zram" > /etc/modules-load.d/zram.conf'

	Most people recommend creating one disk per processor core. This is specified as an option when the kernel module is loaded, here's an example for a 4 core system:

	sudo sh -c 'echo "options zram num_devices=4" > /etc/modprobe.d/zram.conf'

	Now that the number of disks has been set, we must also specify their size. This could be done in /etc/runit/core-services/03-zram.sh or in /etc/rc.local. Add the following lines to either file, adjusted to however many disks you created earlier. The size you select also depends on your system needs and available RAM. This example adds 4GB zram swap to a system.

	# set sizes for zram drives
	zramctl --find --size 1G
	zramctl --find --size 1G
	zramctl --find --size 1G
	zramctl --find --size 1G

	# make it swap
	mkswap /dev/zram0
	mkswap /dev/zram1
	mkswap /dev/zram2
	mkswap /dev/zram3

	# activate
	swapon /dev/zram0
	swapon /dev/zram1
	swapon /dev/zram2
	swapon /dev/zram3

-disabling unneeded services-
	to disable unneeded services, just remove the symlink in /var/service
	Examples of uneeded services on a new system:
		agetty-tty3 -through- agetty-tty6 [tty2 is kept as backup]
		dhcpcd [if you have a static ip set]
		sshd [if you are not using ssh on the computer]
-adding custom repository-
	(add section on this)
	to add packages to a custom repo, use sudo xbps-rindex -a /path/to/package/pck.xbps
-install dwarf fortress- [add section on dfhack, stonesense, etc]
	install: SDL gtk+ SDL_image SDL_ttf glu
		if sound is desired: libopenal	
	If an error stating something like "version 'CXXABI_1/3/8' not found" pops up, try to remove libstdc++.so.6 and libgcc_s.so.1 from the DF libs folder. 
		This causes DF to fall back to system versions of these libs, which are usually newer.
-Discord-
	install libatomic
	The app seems to work, but it only detects microphone after something [youtube video] is opened in FireFox (figure out how to fix this)
		turn minimize to tray and open discord off in Linux Settings
		turn Hardware acceleration off advanced settings (see if this is still needed)
-Mullvad-
	using the mullvad app doesn't seem to work well through xdeb, just use a config file and wireguard.
	1. install wireguard
	2. use the mullvad config generator page (look at doing through cli), and download the configs, and place them in /etc/wireguard
	3. to turn it on [example]: wg-quick up mullvad-se4 [the se4 part is different, depending on location] [place this command somewhere where it will be executed on startup]
	to disconnect: wg-quick down mullvad-se4
-gpu overclocking - amd gcn and later-
	the third party guis seem quite buggy, just use cli

	enable amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff in grub boot parameters
		add it in the quotes of this line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
		then run: sudo update grub

	You then need to find the file that contains this. Run: readlink -f /sys/class/drm/card0/device.
	find a file named pp_od_clk_voltage It's path will be something like /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0
	the file for the powercap is named power1_cap and it's path looks like: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/hwmon/hwmon1

	Now make a script and place it somewhere with startup stuff
	it contains commands to set the clocks and volts for mem and core, and the power limit
	example:
	#!/bin/sh
	#sets clock to 1450mhz and voltage to 1150mv for powerstate seven [look at the file for how many powerstates]
	sudo sh -c "echo 's 7 1450 1150' > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/pp_od_clk_voltage"
	#sets memclock and volts to 2065 and 950 for mem powerstate 2
	sudo sh -c "echo 'm 2 2065 950' > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/pp_od_clk_voltage"
	# sets powerlimit to 120 watts
	sudo sh -c "echo 120000000 > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/hwmon/hwmon1/power1_cap"
	#applies the settings to the gpu
	sudo sh -c "echo 'c' > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/pp_od_clk_voltage"

	WARNING: DOUBLE CHECK THE VALUES ARE CORRECT. Run the script without the last command, then take a look at the files to make sure settings look good.
	remember to chmod +x the script

	finally, add a command /path/to/script.sh to rc.local to run it on startup. (figure out how to put it in .xinitrc instead, so stability on login line is not affected)
